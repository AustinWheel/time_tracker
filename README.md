# Time Tracker
This is a really simple mobile app that will let you create activities and track the amount of time you have logged on them.
This way you can track how long you spent at the gym, or even how long you spent cooking or reading!
I've really been meaning to build something like this for myself because I really enjoyed how certain games tracked the hours I had played for, and I wanted something similar for the other productive areas of my life. This kinda helps me set goals and also feel good about seeing all the progress I have put into different activities :).
If you have any ideas/suggestions let me know at austinwheeler1112@gmail.com!

Below are some images so you can see what the app looks like before it is available on app stores.
